# TREND-AWARE ARBUSDT SCALPING CONFIGURATION
# Designed to avoid the consecutive loss pattern

# === POSITION SIZING (Risk Management) ===
TRADE_SYMBOL=ARBUSDT
TRADE_QUANTITY=100  # Reduced from 228 (56% reduction)
# Smaller size = smaller losses when wrong

# === ASYMMETRIC TARGETS (Anti-Trend Protection) ===
PROFIT_TARGET=0.0025  # 0.25% (reduced from 0.4%)
STOP_LOSS=0.008       # 0.8% (increased from 0.2%)

# Need only 76% win rate to break even

# === MUCH MORE SELECTIVE ENTRY ===
MIN_SPREAD=0.004      # 0.4% (doubled from 0.2%)
# Only trade when spread is exceptionally attractive
# This filters out most "fake" opportunities

# === MINIMAL MARTINGALE (Risk Control) ===
MARTINGALE_ENABLED=true  # Disable martingale completely
# OR if you want some recovery:
MARTINGALE_MULTIPLIER=1.5
MARTINGALE_MAX_STEPS=3    # Only one additional trade
HALT_ON_MAX_STEPS=true

# === EXTENDED COOLDOWNS (Trend Avoidance) ===
COOLDOWN_SECONDS=300      # 5 minutes between trades
EXTENDED_COOLDOWN_SECONDS=7200  # 2 hours after losses

# === ALTERNATIVE: RANGE-ONLY CONFIGURATION ===
# Use these settings only during sideways markets:
# PROFIT_TARGET=0.002   # 0.2%
# STOP_LOSS=0.002       # 0.2%
# MIN_SPREAD=0.006      # 0.6% - extremely selective
# COOLDOWN_SECONDS=600  # 10 minutes
